        <h1>Fitness and Diet</h1>
    </header> 
    <article>I'm developing a comprehensive website for fitness and diet 
        enthusiasts. The platform offers a personalized two-week program 
        featuring three diet meals and three exercises each day, tailored 
        to the user's weight, height, gender, and intensity level. Users 
        can track their daily progress, access detailed exercise instructions, 
        and discover nutritious recipes. The goal is to provide a holistic 
        approach to fitness and nutrition, ensuring users stay motivated and 
        achieve their health goals. The website also includes reminders to 
        stay hydrated, enhancing the overall wellness experience.
